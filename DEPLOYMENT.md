## üîí Making Deployment Public

If your deployment platform is showing a login page, it's likely due to:

1. **Platform-level authentication** - Check your platform's project settings and disable any authentication/password protection
2. **Private preview URLs** - Some platforms require login for preview deployments but not production
3. **Organization settings** - Check if your organization has default authentication enabled

### **Common Fixes:**

**Vercel:**
- Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Deployment Protection**
- Ensure "Password Protection" is **disabled**

**Netlify:**
- Go to: **Site settings ‚Üí Visitor access**
- Ensure "Password protection" is **disabled**

**Render:**
- Private services require authentication by default
- Change service type to **Web Service (Public)**

1. Load immediately without any login prompt
2. Show "AI Business Card Scanner" heading
3. Display file upload interface
4. Work for ANY visitor (no account needed)
